This is a simple service to serve HTML renderings of man pages,
generated by mandoc.  It is designed to run locally, as a systemd
socket-activated service, behind another HTTP reverse proxy,
e.g. nginx.

# Running

The program expects an established socket on fd 0; for example systemd
unit files can be like

```
# handoc.socket
[Unit]
Description=handoc

[Socket]
ListenStream=[::]:8888
Accept=yes
```

```
# handoc@.service
[Unit]
Description=handoc

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/handoc
StandardInput=socket
StandardError=journal
```

Generated pages refer to a stylesheet at `/style.css`, so configure
such a static file in your proxy server; for example, with the file at
`/srv/http/man/style.css`, nginx configuration can be like:

```
    server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        server_name man;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8888;
        }

        location /style.css {
            root /srv/http/man;
        }
    }
```

# Viewing

Visit `http://man/open` to auto-search a man page named "open";
substitute your configured domain name, of course.
`http://man/open.3p` to specify section 3p.  They are implemented as
redirects to a more verbose path, you can also type the long form if
you like.

A CSS file is not included, you probably want to create your own.
